Welcome to afex. Important changes in the current version:
- Functions for ANOVAs have been renamed to: aov_car(), aov_ez(), and aov_4().
- ANOVA functions return an object of class 'afex_aov' as default, see: ?aov_car
- 'afex_aov' objects can be passed to lsmeans for contrasts and follow-up tests.
- Reset previous (faster) behavior via: afex_options(return_aov='nice')
- Many more arguments can now be set globally via options, see: afex_options()
